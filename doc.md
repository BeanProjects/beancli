## Release Process for Go CLI Application with Embedded Version

Here's a release process for your Go CLI application with embedded version information, suitable for both DevOps and development teams:

**Preparation:**

1. **Versioning:**
    * Implement a versioning scheme (e.g., semantic versioning).
    * Ensure the version information can be easily accessed within the code or a extenal git repository. 

2. **Version Embedding:**
    * Use a build flag (`-ldflags`) during compilation to embed the version information into the binary. Here's an example:

    ```
    go build -ldflags=...
    ```

    Tthe running script is in ./scripts/build

3. **Testing:**
    * Conduct thorough testing of the new version

**Development Team Responsibilities:**

1. **Development and Testing:**
    * Develop new features and bug fixes.
    * Write unit and integration tests for changes made.
    * Update documentation and release notes reflecting changes in the new version.

2. **Pull Requests and Code Review:**
    * Submit pull requests for code changes and new features.
    * Participate in code reviews for other developers' work.

3. **Version Update:**
    * Update the version number in the codebase when necessary (e.g., upon significant changes or bug fixes).

**DevOps Team Responsibilities:**

1. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):**
    * Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process upon code changes.
    * Integrate automated testing tools (e.g., Go testing framework) into the pipeline.
    * Configure the pipeline to use the appropriate `-ldflags` during the build stage to embed the version information.

2. **Release Deployment:**
    * Deploy the new version to the production environment using appropriate deployment methods (e.g., package managers, container orchestration tools).
    * Update any configuration files or environment variables needed for the new version.

3. **Monitoring and Rollbacks:**
    * Monitor the application health and performance after deployment.
    * Have a rollback plan in place in case of unforeseen issues with the new version.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Release Notes:** Maintain detailed release notes for each version, outlining changes, bug fixes, and known issues.
* **Version Control:** Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track code changes and maintain different versions.
* **Communication:** Maintain clear communication between development and DevOps teams throughout the release process.

By following this process, you can streamline your Go CLI application releases, ensuring a smooth and efficient delivery of new versions. Remember to adapt and personalize this process based on your specific project requirements and team structure.
